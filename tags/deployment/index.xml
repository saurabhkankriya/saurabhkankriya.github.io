Here, I focus on my thought process after a model is accepted to be placed into production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1-the-mindset-shift"&gt;1. The Mindset Shift&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting the model into production is more of an engineering job. You have to think from the perspective of a software engineer and not as a data scientist. The reason being a software engineer thinks of the entire end-to-end system. Sometimes, also requires the knowledge of DevOps if a dedicated team isn&amp;rsquo;t available. After the model training phase is done, the problems you&amp;rsquo;ll face are likely going to be practical engineering problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
