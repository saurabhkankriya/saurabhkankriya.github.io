&lt;p&gt;It lets one create stuff with minimal resources that can be useful for others. Imagine kids developing this superpower at an early age. They are not discouraged easily and can overcome challenges better than an adult. Their imagination does not know practical limitations. Programming is translating this imagination into building stuff. This stuff can be anything - a robot to play around with, a nice website, solving mathematical problems, creating games, intelligent solutions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
