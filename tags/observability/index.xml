&lt;p&gt;Datadog and Grafana are both popular tools for monitoring and visualizing metrics in real-time, but they have some key differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Datadog is a proprietary software platform that frequently releases a set of new features. Datadog has is a strong focus on infrastructure monitoring, which includes features such as tracing, log management, and APM (application performance monitoring). This can be particularly advantageous for organizations that rely heavily on cloud-based infrastructure and microservices, as it provides a holistic view of the entire system and allows for more effective troubleshooting and optimization. It is a completely cloud-based solution and does not offer the hosting of an on-prem solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
