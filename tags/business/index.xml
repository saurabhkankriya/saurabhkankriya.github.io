They not only learn a new skill but technically are not blocked from finding answers from data. Data is the new oil and having someone who can make sense of it is a great addition to the organization. Here are some ways in which Business Users can learn python:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just learn enough basics&lt;/strong&gt;
As a business user, you may not be required to learn concepts like Object Oriented Programming, Decorators, etc. Simply understanding how a python script runs, writing functions, installing packages, and solving common errors is enough to get started. The rest of the things can be picked up when you are progressing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
