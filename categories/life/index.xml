The point I want to drive here is to respect individual choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start to write online, a big dilemma you&amp;rsquo;d face is to narrow down on a niche. What if I just want to write about topics that interest me. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to narrow down on one thing. I like tech and other things. I look for an intersection. Moreover, if I just talk about a single topic my identity will always be attached to that one thing. I will always be under pressure of pleasing my audience and their expectations on that topic. I am writing for just 1 person. This person is me 2 years ago. How boring it would be if I chose between tech or other things. I am choosing tech and other things. These other things help me explore curiosities and the other side of the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
