In Hindi, we have a famous saying: "Sahi Jagah Pe Dikhega, Tabhi To Bikega" which means to sell, you have to make it (it= you, your work/ product) visible at relevant places. Good work/ product doesn't have any value if no one knows about it. Marketing is what gives it exposure to others and makes it valuable.

In the last atomic essay (no. 3) we saw why it is important to market yourself. In this essay we see different ways to do it:

**Establish a reputation** First, you have to get a reputation as a person who knows his stuff, who can produce good quality work under deadline stress, and who can solve problems. You also often need a reputation as a team player (which means something different to managers than low-level employees). The first step should be all about creating perceptions about yourself and the kind of work you do.

**Having a monthly connect with your manager** Most of us think we can show all our work and accomplishments during the annual meetings. Instead, we should showcase it every month. Show the progress you have done so far, and the obstacles you have overcome. What do you plan for next month and the next quarter? State your learning goals. If you can quantitively measure your progress and results, it has an altogether different impact. This makes your work visible to your manager.

**Write about it** Explain something that got you results in a written format. You never who can get benefit from it. Write all the details about it. You can write on internal platforms like Yammer or open platforms like LinkedIn, your blog, etc.

**Do Presentations** Learned something new? Know a topic better? Don't hoard the knowledge but share it with your peers. Do presentations internally within your team and educate others. This sends a subtle message; for a topic x, you are the one who knows stuff. You can also do this using platforms like Meetup. This will also increase your network.

**Network** As clich√©, as it may sound but having a relevant network, is the best way to market yourself. This network of people can help you reach a wider audience and expose you to a lot of opportunities. Go to events; both internal and external. Be the first to introduce yourself and the work you do.

When you share knowledge, you become an authority on that topic. Imposter syndrome won't allow you to believe this but do it anyway. Do market yourself in subtle ways but also don't overdo it.
