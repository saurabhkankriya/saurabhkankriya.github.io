Wikipedia defines Pythonic code as:

```"Pythonic code may use Python idioms well, be natural or show fluency in the language, or conform with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability."```

Lets see why you should write Pythonic code:

1. Easy Maintenance: When it comes to writing faster and scalable architecture code, we should strive to leverage pythonic code. Using pythonic code, we can use the libraries more efficiently. Multi-threading, hyper-threading becomes easy

2. High Performant Code: Writing idiomatic python code often runs faster because it considers the language constructs and renders an optimized execution. Pythonic code also uses less RAM when solving big problems that require huge computing power. If you properly utilize the python code, its speed can become comparable to that of C.

3. Fewer Bugs: More bugs are introduced due to badly written code. We can eliminate these if the entire team follows some set standards. A well-written code is easy to debug and thus leads to a faster development cycle.

4. Enforces Clean Architecture: When you commit to using standards of a programming language, you ensure the projects follow a clean architecture. A clean architecture may result in writing less code that is reusable.

5. Embraces The Philosophy of Python: When you write idiomatic code, you are using the recommendations of the Python core developers and recommendations from the user community. They are the ones who know the best use of the language and how it can address many core philosophies. This can help you address many design patterns.

If you are just starting with Python, don't write idiomatic python code from the start. Write code that gets the thing done. Then spend some time reading the code of others and learn from it. Implement what you are learning in your projects. Give yourself time to learn, implement and grow.
