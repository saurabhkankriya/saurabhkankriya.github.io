Stackoverflow is an indispensable resource but most of the users are under-utilizing the platform.

Stackoverflow is more than just a question-answering platform for coders. Apart from helping with code, it provides valuable insights into why something will and will not work.

Don't make the mistake of using Stackoverflow without creating an account. Having an account will give you the following benefits:

**Save Time by Upvoting**: Upvote questions so next time you face an issue, you will realize that you have been in the same position before. Upvote answers you found useful so you can simply reuse the solution that worked for you in the past. Upvoting also helps the owner of the answer in increasing their reputation and is seen as a reliable solution.

**Bookmark**: You can bookmark some questions which you tend to refer to frequently. Common scenarios are of methods in python, pandas, and git. No matter how many years we have been using these, the need to search Stackoverflow for some scenarios is inevitable.

**Profile**: Giving helpful answers increases your reputation and lands you badges for new milestones you reach. Mentioning a Stackoverflow profile helps to make your resume stronger.

**Answer Questions to Help Others**: There will be cases where existing answers are not up to date. Whenever you find something that works for you, try to answer it under the question. This will help others.

**Get Hired**: Most developers don't realize but Stackoverflow also provides a platform for jobs. A lot of global, remote-first companies are hiring from Stackoverflow. Having a good Stackoverflow profile can make employers reach out to you.

**Help Community**: You can upvote helpful content, raise flags for posts that don't comply with the platform policies, and comment on what works and what doesn't. When you do this, you are helping the developer community at large. Your actions will be rewarded.

It takes several years to build a good profile on Stackoverflow. Commitment to providing quality and helpful solutions can boost your reputation. You can save a lot of time by simply revisiting your profile to find all the things we discussed above. Update your profile and start contributing. The fastest way to grow is to help someone else.
