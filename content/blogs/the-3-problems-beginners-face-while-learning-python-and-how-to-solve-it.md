I have been working in IT for 7 years. Since starting as a BI Analyst and working my way up to a Data Scientist, I have learned a lot about what it takes to solve some of the biggest problems people face in our industry. I was once a beginner and I know the problems they face.

People want to learn Python and excel in their careers. But they are often puzzled which resource to choose and how to proceed. Plethora of options are available; both online and offline. Everyone you ask has their own recommendations. The choice becomes even more difficult.

The 3 problems and their solutions:

1. **How to select the right learning resource?** 
Spend some time introspecting your learning goals and the mode of learning that suits you. Do you prefer books/ course/ YouTube videos/ blogs or paid tutors? Depending on this you should take the decision on selecting one resource for learning.

2. **What are my goto resources if I get stuck?** Identify the communities, users, resources that can help you get unstuck. Join a local study group on meetup or any other platform.

3. **How to make sure you complete what you commit yourself to?** You are more likely to complete a learning resource if it is project based i.e. it has a end. There will be always be attractive options out there which will compete for your attention but you need to ignore them.

Take small, focused action and then turn to other options when you are comfortable. Supplement your learning with other material but the primary learning resource should be your main focus. Hope this useful. Let me know what do you think.
