Side projects are good ways to explore your curiosities or to learn a new skill. The prerequisite for any side project is it should be fun, learning/ value-oriented, will either make you money in the short or long term, etc.

Unfortunately, once you initiate a side project, it can get overwhelming to continue working on it or complete it. Here is my framework for side projects:

Determine if the side project is worthy of your time:
Say NO: If there is too much already on your plate, simply refuse the urge/ request to work on something new.

Ask Questions: Is the project going to be valuable for anyone? What is the tradeoff if I start working on it? Am I going to learn something? Does a better alternative already exist that I can do rather than reinventing the wheel? These questions can help you decide if taking the plunge is worth the effort.

Threshold of saying Yes: If the other projects are 80% completed or at a level that improving them further will not produce significant results, then you can opt-in to work on the new project.

Backlog of ideas: Have a dedicated notebook and notes app to jot down ideas that come to your mind. You never know what idea will come up. You don't need to work on it straight away but having a record will help you not miss out on new side project ideas.

Here's how, you can complete your side projects:
Step 1: Have a schedule
Not having a schedule can cost you a lot in the long run.

Plan out if you are going to work on weekends or 30-60 mins daily during weekdays. Alternatively, you can also dedicate the early morning or late night to work on your side projects. The key is to work during the time you are least distracted.

Step 2: Have a maximum of 3 projects you can work on
When you have too much to manage, it gets difficult to complete it.

I found it difficult to work and manage projects that were more than 3. I recommend it is better to work on a manageable number of projects.

Step 3: Intentional Context Switch
It is normal to hit a plateau and see yourself not making any progress.

If you feel you are stuck somewhere, try to work on the other side projects. This project switch will help your brain to reset the focus and overcome the mental plateau.

Step 4: Seek help
Often when we are stuck, a pair of fresh eyes can help us get unstuck. Please seek external help early after doing some research on your own to move the needle.

Side projects are crucial. You get stressed when you are not able to manage things and things start to get out of hand. Hope these points help you. Let me know how you approach and complete your side projects.
