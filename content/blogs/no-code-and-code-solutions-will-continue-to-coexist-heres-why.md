The No-Code offerings are gaining momentum but it is equally important to understand the shortcomings associated with their use.

A no-code solution enables users to make use of drag-and-drop components without coding to build a software app. In the last couple of years, no-code solutions have gained a lot of momentum. Popular examples include bubble.io, Airtable, etc. There are quite a few advantages of using no-code approaches over coding:

**Rapid Prototyping**: Have an idea and want to create a Minimum Viable Project (MVP)? No-code solutions should be your go-to choice.

**Easy to start**: No coding experience is required to get started. Any business user or a non-tech person can simply go through a couple of tutorials and quickly get started.

**No need to hire a Software Developer**: With no code, you don't need to hire and pay a hefty amount to a Software Developer.

Let us take a look at the shortcomings where coding can come to the rescue:

**Tied to a vendor**: If you develop an MVP with an X vendor and for some reason, you want to move to vendor Y. Your MVP may break or you will be required to rework completely. With programming, you are never really tied to anything.

**Doesn't consider edge cases**: The No-Code tools are often designed for a larger user group. If your idea of an MVP is unique, you may not find the exact component/ tool for your use case. With programming, you can create custom logic and use it in your use case.

**Lack of fine-grain control**: With the No-Code solution, there is no fine-grain control of things in the background. Templates offered by a vendor may be rigid and it becomes difficult to customize. Scalability can become a problem if the vendor doesn't have the right infrastructure in place. Quality checks and security are completely in the hands of the developers and can be audited easily.

No-Code solutions are good for quickly developing an MVP and if you are bootstrapping, you may find programming a better approach in the long term. By all means, learn to use no-code tools. But be aware some shortcomings can be addressed by coding. Have the best of both worlds.
