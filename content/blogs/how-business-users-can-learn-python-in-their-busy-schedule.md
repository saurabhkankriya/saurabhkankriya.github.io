Business Users can benefit a lot if they know how to use python. They not only learn a new skill but technically are not blocked from finding answers from data. Data is the new oil and having someone who can make sense of it is a great addition to the organization. Here are some ways in which Business Users can learn python:

**Just learn enough basics**
As a business user, you may not be required to learn concepts like Object Oriented Programming, Decorators, etc. Simply understanding how a python script runs, writing functions, installing packages, and solving common errors is enough to get started. The rest of the things can be picked up when you are progressing.

**Use pandas instead of Excel**
Replace Excel with pandas for your day-to-day activities. Whatever you can do with Excel, you can perform the same operations (and advanced ones) using pandas. There are 2 advantages:

- Your steps are reproducible by someone else.
- You enforce the use of python which leads to habit formation.


**Use of python for data analysis**
Data analysis is the process in which data is explored to discover patterns that help us make business decisions. Data analysis extracts and queries data from different sources, perform exploratory data analysis, visualizes data, prepares reports, and presents it to the business decision-making authorities.

Starting to learn python can be intimidating at first. But as time passes, you get comfortable. Within a month of consistent use, you'd be using python with ease. Find someone who can help you get started and assist you when you are stuck. Happy learning!
